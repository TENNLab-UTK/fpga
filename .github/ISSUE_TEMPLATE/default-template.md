# Problem
Describe the shortcoming concisely from the top-down, starting with the overall goal and then expanding with specific details and/or steps to reproduce an issue.

# Proposed Solution
Describe the ideal or expected user experience. Then relate that, if you can, to specific changes you want reflected in the library.

# Hurdles
Explain any potential snags or side effects and how the proposed solution avoids or mitigates them.

# Expected API Impacts
Identify what impact to the existing API the change will have. Categorize as none (purely functional improvements that don't affect method signatures), non-breaking (additive changes that increase the interface space), and **breaking** (interface changes that would make existing user code non-functional or degraded)
